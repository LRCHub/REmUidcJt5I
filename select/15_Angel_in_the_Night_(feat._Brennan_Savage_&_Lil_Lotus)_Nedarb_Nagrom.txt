Can you feel the time pass, life move fast?

Can you feel the time pass, life move fast?
Do a hundred down the highway, I won't last
I'm like an angel in the night, in an all-white dress
You like an angel when we fight, sniffin' on white meds

And I can see in your face and when you're walkin' away
And I don't even think you love me when you're callin' my name
It's like we're falling apart now
And we're just waiting to come down

Bitch, you like a demon, you will not leave me alive
I can hear you screaming through the door when I'm inside now
She just want the cream, she need the money, it's a sad sight
I just think it's funny, catch a vibe with me

And baby, I'm trying, I hate to see you cry like that
And when I leave, girl, you know that I'ma come right back
Yeah, I guess I really need you (Yeah, I guess I really need you)
It's getting hard just to believe you
(It's getting hard just to believe you)
Falling down, down, down (I'm falling down)
I just want you around, 'round, 'round (Just want you around)
Take me to your hometown (Your hometown)

Baby, hold me down, I got problems for real
I need help but there's nobody to feel what I feel
I cannot forget the moment that you walked away from me
I will not regret the time I almost died, so pray for me

Can you feel the time pass, life move fast
Do a hundred down the highway, I won't last
I'm like an angel in the night with an all-white dress
You like an angel when we fight, sniffing on white meds

And I can see in your face and when you're walkin' away
And I don't even think you love me when you're callin' my name
It's like we're falling apart now
And we're just waiting to come down
